## Implementation Priority

1. Phase 1: Core Enhancement
   - Enhance @eduflow/common with security utilities
   - Enhance @eduflow/middleware with Redis support
   - Enhance @eduflow/validators with core schemas
   - Enhance @eduflow/types with new type definitions

2. Phase 2: New Core Libraries
   - Implement @eduflow/database
   - Implement @eduflow/rbac
   - Implement @eduflow/history
   - Implement @eduflow/notifications

3. Phase 3: Integration & Testing
   - Integration tests for all libraries
   - Documentation
   - Example implementations
   - Performance testing

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - Individual utility functions
   - Validation rules
   - Type checks
   - Middleware functions

2. Integration Tests
   - Cross-library functionality
   - Database operations
   - Event handling
   - Role management

3. Performance Tests
   - Redis operations
   - History tracking overhead
   - Role validation speed
   - Event publishing latency

## Documentation Requirements

1. API Documentation
   - Function signatures
   - Type definitions
   - Usage examples
   - Best practices

2. Integration Guides
   - Setup instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Common patterns
   - Troubleshooting

3. Security Guidelines
   - Best practices
   - Common pitfalls
   - Configuration recommendations
